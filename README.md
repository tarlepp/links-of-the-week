# What is this?

I'm quite active in OS (Open Source) communities social media channels eg. IRC, Slack, etc. and I 
noticed that there is a lot of interested links / articles that I would like to share with you all.

So basically that is what this repository will be, I'll try to group links per week, and I'll try to
update this repository all the time - I have noticed that I remember to see some article "somewhere"
but cannot really find that anymore.

And that said, this repository will also help me to remember some stuff.

If _you_ have some interesting links / articles feel free to make a pull request to this repository.
